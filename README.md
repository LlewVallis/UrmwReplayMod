# URMW Replay Mod
A modified version of the amazing Replay Mod for Unofficial Ranked Missile Wars match recording.

## URMW Features
* Direct messages are not picked up by the recorder. A direct message is detected with the `âž›` character.

## Building
Make sure your sub-projects are up-to-date: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

For compiling 1.7.10, you must run `./gradlew :jGui:1.7.10:setupDecompWorkspace :1.7.10:setupDecompWorkspace` once after the initial clone. This may take quite some time.

### No IDE
You can build the mod by running `./gradlew build` (or just `./gradlew shadowJar`). You can then find the final jar files in `versions/$MCVERSION/build/libs/`.
You can also build single versions by running `./gradlew :1.8:build` (or just `./gradlew :1.8:shadowJar`) (builds the MC 1.8 version).

### IntelliJ
For the initial setup run `./gradlew idea genIntellijRuns`.
You also need to enable the Mixin annotation processor:
1. Go to File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors
2. Tick "Enable annotation processing"
3. Add a new entry to the "Annotation Processor options"
4. For Forge, set the name to "reobfSrgFile" and the value to "$path/versions/$MCVERSION/build/mcp-srg.srg" where you replace $path with the full 
path to the folder containing the gradlew file
4. For Fabric, set the name to "inMapFileNamedIntermediary" and the value to "$HOME/.gradle/caches/fabric-loom/mappings/net.fabricmc.yarn-tiny-$YARNVERSION" where you replace $HOME with your home folder and $YARNVERSION with the respective yarn version used by the RM

### Eclipse

## Development
### Branches
Loosely based on [this branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) with `stable` instead of `master`.

TL;DR:
Main development happens on the `develop` branch, snapshots are built from this branch.
The `stable` branch contains the most recent release.

The `master` branch is solely to be used for the `version.json` file that contains a list of all versions
used by the clients to check for updates of this mod.

### The Preprocessor
To support multiple Minecraft versions with the ReplayMod, a [JCP](https://github.com/raydac/java-comment-preprocessor)-inspired preprocessor is used:
```java
        //#if MC>=11200
        // This is the block for MC >= 1.12.0
        category.addDetail(name, callable::call);
        //#else
        //$$ // This is the block for MC < 1.12.0
        //$$ category.setDetail(name, callable::call);
        //#endif
```
Any comments starting with `//$$` will automatically be introduced / removed based on the surrounding condition(s).
Normal comments are left untouched. The `//#else` branch is optional.

Conditions can be nested arbitrarily but their indention shall always be equal to the indention of the code at the `//#if` line.
The `//$$` shall be aligned with the inner-most `//#if`.
```java
    //#if MC>=10904
    public CPacketResourcePackStatus makeStatusPacket(String hash, Action action) {
        //#if MC>=11002
        return new CPacketResourcePackStatus(action);
        //#else
        //$$ return new CPacketResourcePackStatus(hash, action);
        //#endif
    }
    //#else
    //$$ public C19PacketResourcePackStatus makeStatusPacket(String hash, Action action) {
    //$$     return new C19PacketResourcePackStatus(hash, action);
    //$$ }
    //#endif
```
Code for the more recent MC version shall be placed in the first branch of the if-else-construct.
Version-dependent import statements shall be placed separately from and after all other imports.
Common version dependent code (including the fml and forge event bus) are available as static methods/fields in the `MCVer` class.

The source code in `src/main` is generally for the most recent Minecraft version and is automatically passed through the
preprocessor when any of the other versions are built (gradle projects `:1.8`, `:1.8.9`, etc.).
Do **NOT** edit any of the code in `versions/$MCVERSION/build/` as it is automatically generated and will be overwritten without warning.

You can change the version of the code in `src/main` if you wish to develop/debug with another version of Minecraft:
```bash
./gradle :1.9.4:setCoreVersion # switches all sources in src/main to 1.9.4
```
If you do so, you'll also have to refresh the project in your IDE.

Make sure to switch back to the most recent branch before committing!
Care should also be taken that switching to a different branch and back doesn't introduce any uncommitted changes (e.g. due to different indention, especially in case of nested conditions).

Some files may use the same preprocessor with different keywords.
If required, more file extensions and keywords can be added in the `preprocess` block of the `versions/common.gradle` script.
